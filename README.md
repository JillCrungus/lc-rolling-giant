# Rolling Giant

> Made by Andrew Burke

Adds the Rolling Giant as a Coilhead variant into Lethal Company. Sounds are included.

Features:

- Adds a new Coilhead variant into the game with a configurable chance of spawning
- Coilheads and Rolling Giants can co-exist
- Rolling Giants can be scanned to read their own unique bestiary entry
- Rolling Giants have their own scan id so it doesn't conflict with the existing Coilheads
